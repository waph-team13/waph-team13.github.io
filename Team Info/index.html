    <h2>Overview of this Course</h2>
    <p>This course explores the complexities of hacking and web application development, giving us the tools we need to succeed in both fields. We cover the fundamentals of front-end development, such as HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS, as well as back-end development, which uses PHP and MySQL, through a combination of theory and practical experience. Understanding web application architecture and the mutually beneficial interplay between client-side and server-side components is a primary goal. We also explore the topic of web application security, where they use hands-on exercises to find typical weaknesses and threats. The goal of the course is to provide us with the skills necessary to create reliable and secure web applications as well as the knowledge to recognise, stop, and lessen any security risks. By fusing theoretical ideas with practical. Through real-world examples, students learn how to develop and deploy web-based solutions that follow safe programming standards and guidelines. In summary, this course equips students with the necessary skills to effectively navigate the intricate realm of web development and cybersecurity, allowing them to construct robust and secure web applications that adhere to industry standards.</p>
